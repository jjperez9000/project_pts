This is a project that I made for myself to track ping pong scores on the Apple Watch. 
It is a simple app that will persistently track what a player's overall match score is,
and it allows the user to configure a game to then be tracked. 

It allows players to determine if the game goes to 11 or 21 as well as who can serve first, and it has a marker on
the game screen that says who is currently serving.
